# R Projects

This folder is mostly work from classes.

Linear Algebra was an applied problem where I was looking to determine intermediate demand of different sectors in the economy.

Econometrics course focuses on statistics and applying with R. This includes OLS, logistic regression, time series.

For the Econometrics final project I looked at the NAWS dataset and tried to determine what differentiates high earners vs low earners in agriculture. I used a log-lin regression model and commented through my work to demonstrate the residual tests I was using.
