Forecasting is a time-dependent subset of prediction where consecutive observations are **not** independent. We have autocorrelation when there correlation between time points, white noise if there is not.



## Stochastic process

Stochastic process - Sequence of random variables	

Sample path - one sample sequence of the stochastic process 



Stationary - we are at equilibrium, just bounces around

- Constant mean, constant sd, no seasonality

- Examples - white noise, moving average
  - White noise (not predictable) - mean of 0, sd of 1, no corr between lags
- No - random walk
